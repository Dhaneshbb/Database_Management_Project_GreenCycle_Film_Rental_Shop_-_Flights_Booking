############################## 10 - Views & Data Manipulation

Challenge:
- Update all rental prices that are 0.99 to 1.99.
- Alter the customer table:
  1. Add the column initials (data type varchar(10)).
  2. Update the values to the actual initials, for example, Frank Smith should be F.S.

Challenge:
- Delete the rows in the payment table with payment_id 17064 and 17067.

Challenge: CREATE TABLE AS
- Create a new table named "customer_spendings" and populate it with the total spending per customer.

Challenge: 
- Create a view called "films_category" that shows a list of film titles including their title, length, and category name, ordered descendingly by the length.
- Filter the results to only the movies in the category 'Action' and 'Comedy'.

Challenge:
- In this challenge, we use the view "v_customer_info" as follows:
  - Create a view "v_customer_info" to display customer information along with address details.
 
CREATE VIEW v_customer_info AS
SELECT cu.customer_id,
	cu.first_name || ' ' || cu.last_name AS name,
	a.address,
	a.postal_code,
	a.phone,
	city.city,
	country.country
	 FROM customer cu
	 JOIN address a ON cu.address_id = a.address_id
	 JOIN city ON a.city_id = city.city_id
	 JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
ORDER BY customer_id;


Tasks:
1. Rename the view to "v_customer_information".
2. Rename the customer_id column to "c_id".
3. Add the "initial" column as the third column to the view by replacing the view.
